You’re the Monica to my Chandler — the one who keeps things together when I’m spiraling, who believes in me when I can’t find matching socks, and who makes the hard stuff feel softer just by being there. (Also, you're the only one allowed to yell at me for leaving toothpaste in the sink.)",

      "You make life feel like Central Perk with extra whipped cream. Like a game of Bamboozled where we both win. Like a Thanksgiving dinner without the turkey on your head (although, I’d still love you with it on). You’re the reason I believe in soulmates — and spontaneous proposals with empty ring boxes.",
